# graph_10.py
#
# A graph consists of "nodes".  Each node holds a value, but also
# links that connect to other nodes.
#
#        [A]
#       /   \
#     [B]  [C]--[E]
#      |    /\
#     [D]--/  \
#             [F]
#
# Your challenge in this exercise is to make a data structure for
# representing and creating graphs

def make_node(element):
    # Make a new graph node
    pass

def connect(node1, node2):
    # Connect node1 and node2 together
    pass

def connect_directional(node1, node2):
    # Connect node1 to node2 (One direction only)
    pass

def is_connected(node1, node2):
    # Determine if node1 and node2 are connected to each other
    pass

def shortest_path(node1, node2):
    # Determine the shortest path from node1 to node2
    pass
