# A blockchain distributed data storage consisting of containers 
# (blocks) which are connected. If the data you store in a block 
# is a list of transactions, the coins transferred in the transactions 
# form your cryptocurrency.

print("Data Storage.")

# A single block can hold any type of data you want.
# Chain-> each folder/container/block knows about the 
# folder/container/block before it.
# The whole folder is the blockchain respectively.

print("Blockchain defined.")

# Block chains are not limited to transactions.
# A blockchain is a data store.
# Bitcoin blockchain is a 'list of transactions'. 
# Yes, they know about each other.
# Each block is hashed that is generated from all the parts
# in the block.

print("Cryptography - Hash Algorithms.")

# If you change some input, the output will also change.
# Meaning, a new hash will be generated.

print("What are coins?")

# Coins are transferred with Transactions.
# Changing them into other currencies is not possible inside
# of a blockchain. The value of a coin is
# determined by the value the participants of the
# blockchain network assign to i (i.e. what you're willing to
# pay in 'fiat'..sigh currencies). Coins are 'created' via Mining 
# (as a reward for 'effort').

print("Coins are distributed to Nodes called 'Wallets'")

# A wallet is a node.
# You can send coins through transactions to other wallets.
# Whenever a transaction is created its broadcasted to the nodes.
# The nodes are distributed over the node network.
# They first will verify your identity.
# The transaction is then 'bundled' and stored in a newly generated
# (minded) block.

print("So the base syntax is: ")

# Base Syntax: Basic Blockchain -> List of Coins.
# Loops & Conditionals: Blockchain with Chain Validation.
# Working with Complex Data Structures: Store real blocks and transactions.
# More Functions -> Calculate & Output balances.
# Using Standardard Library - Create real Hashes/Proof of work.
# Reading and Writing Files - Store and Load Blockchain.
# Error Handling - Make Blockchain more Robust (reinforce blockchain).
# Object Oriented Programming: Add a wallet.
# Modules and Packages: Sign Transactions.
# Handling HTTP requests with Flask: Control Blockchain via Web UI.
# HTTP Communication between PyPrograms: Connect Blockchain Nodes.
